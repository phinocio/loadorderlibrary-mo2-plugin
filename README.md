# Load Order Library MO2 Plugin

**NOTE:** This plugin is **_NOT_** ready for actual use! Functionality is missing, and API tokens currently get stored inside of `ModOrganizer.ini` since it is a plugin setting, which is insecure.

The purpose of this plugin is to use the Load Order Library API to allow Mod Organizer 2 users to upload/update their currently selected to Load Order Library. It gets the current game MO2 is managing and uploads the currently selected profile.

# Using an API Token

Using an API token is only necessary if you want to update lists.
